Canyon Strive CFR

Bike description
Looking for a bike that’s built to win at the very highest echelons of Enduro racing? You just found it. Reach the Next Level with the Strive CFR and its Shapeshifter technology. The bike is available in two colors: black and white. Three sizes are available: small, medium and large.

Bike classification
This category also covers the requirements of categories 1-3. In addition it includes use on very harsh, obstacle-scattered terrain with steep gradients and consequently higher speeds. Regular, moderate jumps pose no problem for experienced riders when using these bikes. Extended and regular use in bike parks and tackling “North Shore” sections should be avoided. Due to increased stresses, these bikes should be checked for damage after every ride. Full suspension bikes with mid-level travel are typical in this category.

Two bikes in one
With its Shapeshifter tech, the Strive CFR combines the descending speed and capability of a downhill rig with the climbing efficiency of a trail bike. The ideal combination for hardcore Enduro racing on the toughest stages around. But how? Simply push the handlebar-mounted switch to engage the gas spring located above the shock, and switch between geometries as you ride. Pick Shred mode for maximum downhill performance thanks to a slacker head angle, longer wheelbase, and 160 mm of rear travel. Or go into Pedal mode for better climbing and maximum efficiency thanks to 140 mm rear travel, a shorter wheelbase, and 1.5-degree steeper head and seat tube angles.

Enjoy the silence
The downtube protector shields the carbon frame from ground hits and flying stones. And a further protector on the drive side chainstay dampens noises caused by chain slap on rough trails.
